          <h2>The road to success</h2>
         
          <p>Muse started as a small school band. They are described as an alternative rock, space rock and progressive rock band. They mix sounds from genres such as electronic music, progressive metal and art rock, and forms such as classical music, rock opera and many others. In 2002, Bellamy described Muse as a "trashy three-piece". Since 1999 Muse has released eight studio albums so far. Muse is especially famous for their live shows. During the Drones-Tour in 2015 the british Q magazine wrote about "the greatest show on earth!"</p>

            <tr><th>Album</th><th>Details</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Showbiz (1999)</td><td>The album showcased Muse's aggressive yet melancholic musical style, with lyrics about relationships and their difficulties trying to establish themselves in their hometown.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Origin of Symmetry (2001)</td><td>Origin of Symmetry received positive reviews by critics; NME gave the album 9/10 and wrote: "It's amazing for such a young band to load up with a heritage that includes the darker visions of Cobain and Kafka, Mahler and The Tiger Lillies, Cronenberg and Schoenberg, and make a sexy, populist album."</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Absolution (2003)</td><td>Absolution debuted at number one in the UK and produced Muse's first top-ten hit, "Time Is Running Out", and three top-twenty hits: "Hysteria", "Sing for Absolution" and "Butterflies and Hurricanes". Absolution was eventually certified gold in the US.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Black Holes and Revelations (2006)</td><td>The album's title and themes reflect the band's interest in science fiction. The album charted at number one in the UK, much of Europe, and Australia. In the US, it reached number nine on the Billboard 200.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Resistance (2009)</td><td>The Resistance was the first Muse album produced by the band. Reviews were mostly positive, with praise for its ambition, classical influences and the thirteen-minute, three-part "Exogenesis: Symphony".</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The 2nd Law (2012)</td><td>Bellamy said Muse's next album would include influences from acts such as French house duo Justice and UK electronic rock group Does It Offend You, Yeah?.The trailer, which included dubstep elements, was met with mixed reactions.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Drones (2015)</td><td>A concept album about the dehumanisation of modern warfare, it returned to a simpler rock sound with less elaborate production and genre experimentation. Drones won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 58th Grammy Awards.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Simulation Theory (2018)</td><td>Following the darker themes of Muse's prior albums, Simulation Theory incorporates lighter influences from science fiction and 1980s pop culture, with extensive use of synthesisers. The contemporary political climate of the United States informed the lyrics.</td></tr>
