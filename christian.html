          <h1>Why "Back to the Future" is a perfect film</h1>
          <p>In 1985, Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown used a customized Delorean to travel through time and space. Not only is this movie an absolute classic, but also an example for a perfect film. Let's investigate why. </p>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Back_to_the_Future.jpg" alt="Back to the future cover">
          <h2>Something for Everyone</h2>
          <p>The movie drew 59 Million people into the cinemas in the US alone. So it's save to say, it was a smash hit. Since the overall theme of the movie, time travel, is quite a complex issue, I could only image how hard it must have been to break it down. But it paid off. By having this complicated concept built into a fun and easy to follow storyline, screenwriter and director Robert Zemeckis and his colleague Bob Gale managed to create something, everyone could enjoy. Children would love the movie for its jokes and cool one-liners while adults could get a glimpse of the problems with time travel, like the Grandfather paradox. So it really had something for everyone and it was up to the audience, what to take away from it. </p>
          <h2>A familiar Story</h2>
          <p>People love a good story. But what makes a good story? In his 2004 book "The seven basic plots" Christopher Booker claims that every narrative ever written can be boiled down to one of seven storylines. These include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Overcoming the Monster</li>
            <li>Rags to Riches</li>
            <li>The Quest</li>
            <li>Voyage and Return</li>
            <li>Comedy</li>
            <li>Tragedy</li>
            <li>Rebirth</li>
          </ol>
          <p>"Back to the Future" would fall under plot number 4: Voyage and Return. The characteristics of this trope are an unexpected journey into and through another world, obstacles and a return to the normal world, leaving the hero changed forever. Speaking of a hero: "Back to the Future" also resamples the Hero's Journey by Joseph Campbell perfectly:</p>

          <h3>The Hero's Journey in "Back to the Future"</h3>
          <p>The journey is structured in 12 steps:</p>
          <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*pewPHGzLX7fi8aG5.gif" alt="Hero's Journey" width="420"> 
          <p>Let's start with the Ordinary World. Marty's life is really not that bad, not that special either. He's a teenager, likes to play guitar, skateboarding and his girlfriend. School sucks and so does his family, kind of. But that's about to change, when Dr. Emmett Brown calls him, literally, adventure calls him on the phone.</p>
          <ol start="2">
            <li>Call to Adventure:<p>Doc calls Marty and asks him to help him with an experiment at 1:15am.</p></li>
            <li>Refusal of the Call:<p>Marty not really refuses the call but nearly slept in on it.</p></li>
            <li>Meeting the Mentor:<p>Quite obviously the mentor is Doc.</p> </li>
            <li>Crossing the Threshold:<p>Marty literally crosses it by traveling back in time.</p></li>
            <li>Tests, Allies, Enemies:<p>By mistake Marty prevents his father from meeting his mother, so he has to fix that. That's quite a test if you ask me. Also Biff Tannen is always around the corner trying to mess with him. Thank god he can count on Doc to help him.</p></li>
            <li>Approach:<p>The so-called "innermost cave" would be the dance Marty and his "mother" anttend. But He has a plan to introduce her to his father.</p></li>
            <li>Ordeal, Death & Rebirth:<p>Of course things don't go down as planned and obstacles have to be moved aside.</p></li>
            <li>Reward, Seizing the Sword:<p>With a little help from his friends Marty can bring his parents back together and return to the present.</p></li>
            <li>The Road back:<p>Marty is back in 1985.</p></li>
            <li>Resurrection:<p>Marty wakes up to a new live, because his father stood up to his enemies in the past. Doc is alive and his girlfriend waits for him on his front yard.</p></li>
            <li>Return with the Elixir:<p>The elixir being his new life, Marty lives happily ever after.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>All these structures and concepts help to not only tell a story, but to tell a great story, that will definitely work.</p>

          <h2>The not-bad-either sequels make it a perfect trilogy</h2>
          <p>To all our amusement, Marty and Doc's adventure wasn't over after "Back to the Future". Right at the end of part 1 Doc comes to ask for Marty's help again. Part 2 and 3 may not live all the way up to the original but they don't have to either, as they are not stand-alone installments but they feed from each other and are connected by small hints. Highly observant viewers might catch one connection or another and will be rewarded.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Of course, one could argue, that the back in the future trilogy might not be the most meaningful or technically most sufficient film ever made, but still, it's a really, really good movie. Even despite some major flaws regarding time travel logic, this trilogy is one of the greatest ever made.</p>
